Game details/potential extra credit:

    This implementation uses the SRS rotation system (https://tetris.wiki/Super_Rotation_System) tucks and t-spins are therefore possible.

    A 7-bag (https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Generator) is also implemented- all seven pieces have to appear before the next set of 7 starts.
    This prevents the player from getting a run of bad pieces.

    Score is currently done by number of lines cleared.

    A hold functionality has been added. by pressing 'H' a player can move a piece in/out of hold.

    Music plays when game is over, and when a line is cleared.
